* AMR-Watch Kenya: National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Hub
** Project Overview

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) happens when bacteria and other germs evolve to resist the medicines designed to kill them. In Kenya, 80% of bacteria in some areas are already resistant to multiple antibiotics. Labs test for resistance daily, but this vital data stays scattered across individual hospitals. Without a central system, doctors can't know which antibiotics still work in their region.
AMR-Watch Kenya solves this by creating a simple platform where labs can share their test results, making this life-saving information available to everyone.

** Why This Project Matters:
Kenyan labs already do the tests - I just need to collect the results
Global studies use estimates - I'll provide real Kenyan data
The data exists - it's just not organized or accessible
